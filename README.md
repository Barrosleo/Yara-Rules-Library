# Yara-Rules-Library

## 1. Project Goal & Overview

**Yara-Rules-Library** is a GitHub repository that showcases custom Yara rules developed for malware detection and digital forensics. This repository serves both as:

- **An Educational Resource:**  
  It offers detailed documentation for each custom Yara rule, including descriptions, usage examples, case studies on rule development for malware detection or forensics, and best-practice guides on advanced techniques in rule creation.
  
- **A Practical Tool:**  
  It aggregates custom Yara rules along with sample files for testing. A comprehensive tutorial (via a Jupyter Notebook) details best practices and advanced techniques for Yara rule development.

**Target Audience:**  
Security analysts, malware researchers, digital forensic professionals, and anyone looking to enhance their Yara rule development skills.

## 2. Core Components & Functionality

**Custom Yara Rules:**  
Curated rules located in the `rules/` directory that detect malware and forensic artifacts.

**Documentation:**  
Detailed documentation in the `docs/` directory, including:
- Rule documentation
- Case studies on rule development
- A tutorial on best practices in Yara rule creation
- A cheat sheet for quick reference

**Sample Files:**  
Example files in the `samples/` directory for testing the rules.

**Tutorial Notebook:**  
A Jupyter Notebook in the `notebooks/` directory that walks through Yara rule creation and testing.

## 3. Getting Started & Installation

### Prerequisites:
- Yara (YARA tool) installed on your system
- Python 3.8+  
- Git

### Installation:

1. **Clone the repository:**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Barrosleo/Yara-Rules-Library.git
  cd Yara-Rules-Library
  ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
  ```
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## 4. Usage Examples

Running a Yara scan with a custom rule:
  ```
  yara -r rules/malware_rule1.yar samples/sample_file1.exe
  ```
  This command scans `sample_file1.exe` using the rule `malware_rule1.yar`.

Running the Tutorial Notebook:
Launch Jupyter Notebook and open:
  ```
  jupyter notebook notebooks/Yara_Rules_Tutorial.ipynb
  ```
